# Captcha-Alternative for Visually Impaired Users

P) 💡 Project Overview
This project provides an accessible alternative to traditional image-based CAPTCHAs. It is specifically designed to help **visually impaired and eye-disabled students** navigate web security independently by using riddle-based authentication instead of visual pattern recognition.

T) 🛠 Technical Features
* **Accessibility First:** Optimized for screen readers and high-contrast accessibility tools.
* **Fuzzy Logic Validation:** Uses the `thefuzz` library to allow for minor typos or variations in riddle answers, making it more user-friendly for students with different accessibility needs.
* **Lightweight Backend:** Built with **Python** and **Flask** for fast, reliable performance.
* **JSON-Based Data:** Easily extensible riddle database stored in `riddles.json`.
